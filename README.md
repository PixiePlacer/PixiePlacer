# Introduction
Welcome OpenPnP Community to the **PixiePlacer Wiki**!
The PixiePlacer is a **DIY Pick and Place Machine** for SMD Components based around the amazing software **OpenPnP**. The machine is designed to be low cost and suited towards mid-scale manufacturing. A big shout out to the developers of OpenPnP that keep constantly improving the software.

I wanted to create this Wiki, so that **all information** for this machine is **in one place** and not scattered everywhere.

Something look wrong? Please [let me know](https://github.com/PixiePlacer/PixiePlacer/issues/new)!

## Why the name PixiePlacer? 
The name “PixiePlacer” is a mashup from one of my favorite Youtubers AvE (Arduino vs Evil). “Pixies” are excited electrons that want to start dancing. And since it is a machine for PCB manufacturing I found it very suitable.

**I love opensource** and this is my contribution to the OpenPnP community to give back and motivate others to start building their own Pick and Place!
**So sit back and enjoy the Wiki.**
